<p>&ldquo;The Pilgrims of Hope&rdquo; appeared in <i>The
Commonweal</i> between March 1885 and July 1886, its title being
decided on with the publication of the second part.&nbsp;
Sections I, IV, and VIII were included in <i>Poems by the Way</i>
after the author abandoned his intention of revising it as a
whole.&nbsp; &ldquo;To be concluded&rdquo; stands at the bottom
of the last instalment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chants for Socialists,&rdquo; consisting of songs and
poems written for various occasions and collected into a penny
pamphlet published by the Socialist League in 1885, is here
printed entire (with the exception of &ldquo;The Message of the
March Wind,&rdquo; pp. 3&ndash;6), although &ldquo;The Day is
Coming,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Voice of Toil,&rdquo; and &ldquo;All
for the Cause,&rdquo; were included in <i>Poems by the
Way</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Death Song,&rdquo; which also appears
there, was written for the funeral of Alfred Linnell, who died
from injuries received at a Demonstration in Trafalgar Square on
November 20, 1887.&nbsp; It first appeared in pamphlet form, with
a musical setting by Malcolm Lawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May Day&rdquo; [1892] and &ldquo;May Day, 1894,&rdquo;
appeared in <i>Justice</i>.</p>

THE MESSAGE OF THE MARCH WIND</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Fair</span> now is the
springtide, now earth lies beholding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the eyes of a lover the face of the sun;<br />
Long lasteth the daylight, and hope is enfolding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The green-growing acres with increase begun.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now sweet, sweet it is through the land to be
straying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mid the birds and the blossoms and the beasts of the
field;<br />
Love mingles with love, and no evil is weighing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On thy heart or mine, where all sorrow is
healed.</p>
<p class="poetry">From township to township, o&rsquo;er down and
by tillage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far, far have we wandered and long was the day,<br
/>
But now cometh eve at the end of the village,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where over the grey wall the church riseth grey.</p>
<p class="poetry">There is wind in the twilight; in the white
road before us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The straw from the ox-yard is blowing about;<br />
The moon&rsquo;s rim is rising, a star glitters o&rsquo;er us,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the vane on the spire-top is swinging in
doubt.</p>
<p class="poetry">Down there dips the highway, toward the bridge
crossing over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The brook that runs on to the Thames and the sea.<br
/>
Draw closer, my sweet, we are lover and lover;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This eve art thou given to gladness and me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Shall we be glad always?&nbsp; Come closer and
hearken:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Three fields further on, as they told me down
there,<br />
When the young moon has set, if the March sky should darken,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We might see from the hill-top the great
city&rsquo;s glare.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hark, the wind in the elm-boughs!&nbsp; From
London it bloweth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And telling of gold, and of hope and unrest;<br />
Of power that helps not; of wisdom that knoweth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But teacheth not aught of the worst and the
best.</p>
<p class="poetry">Of the rich men it telleth, and strange is the
story<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How they have, and they hanker, and grip far and
wide;<br />
And they live and they die, and the earth and its glory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has been but a burden they scarce might abide.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hark! the March wind again of a people is
telling;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the life that they live there, so haggard and
grim,<br />
That if we and our love amidst them had been dwelling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My fondness had faltered, thy beauty grown dim.</p>
<p class="poetry">This land we have loved in our love and our
leisure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For them hangs in heaven, high out of their
reach;<br />
The wide hills o&rsquo;er the sea-plain for them have no
pleasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grey homes of their fathers no story to
teach.</p>
<p class="poetry">The singers have sung and the builders have
builded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The painters have fashioned their tales of
delight;<br />
For what and for whom hath the world&rsquo;s book been gilded,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all is for these but the blackness of
night?</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>How long and for what is their patience abiding?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How oft and how oft shall their story be told,<br />
While the hope that none seeketh in darkness is hiding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in grief and in sorrow the world groweth
old?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Come</span> back to the
inn, love, and the lights and the fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fiddler&rsquo;s old tune and the shuffling
of feet;<br />
For there in a while shall be rest and desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there shall the morrow&rsquo;s uprising be
sweet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet, love, as we wend the wind bloweth behind
us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And beareth the last tale it telleth to-night,<br />
How here in the spring-tide the message shall find us;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the hope that none seeketh is coming to
light.</p>
<p class="poetry">Like the seed of midwinter, unheeded,
unperished,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the autumn-sown wheat &rsquo;neath the snow
lying green,<br />
Like the love that o&rsquo;ertook us, unawares and
uncherished,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the babe &rsquo;neath thy girdle that groweth
unseen,</p>
<p class="poetry">So the hope of the people now buddeth and
groweth&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest fadeth before it, and blindness and fear;<br />
It biddeth us learn all the wisdom it knoweth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It hath found us and held us, and biddeth us
hear:</p>
<p class="poetry">For it beareth the message: &ldquo;Rise up on
the morrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And go on your ways toward the doubt and the
strife;<br />
Join hope to our hope and blend sorrow with sorrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seek for men&rsquo;s love in the short days of
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>But lo, the old inn, and the lights and the fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fiddler&rsquo;s old tune and the shuffling
of feet;<br />
Soon for us shall be quiet and rest and desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to-morrow&rsquo;s uprising to deeds shall be
sweet.</p>
<h3><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>II<br />
THE BRIDGE AND THE STREET</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> the midst of the
bridge there we stopped and we wondered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In London at last, and the moon going down,<br />
All sullied and red where the mast-wood was sundered<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the void of the night-mist, the breath of the
town.</p>
<p class="poetry">On each side lay the City, and Thames ran
between it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark, struggling, unheard &rsquo;neath the wheels
and the feet.<br />
A strange dream it was that we ever had seen it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strange was the hope we had wandered to
meet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Was all nought but confusion?&nbsp; What man
and what master<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had each of these people that hastened along?<br />
Like a flood flowed the faces, and faster and faster<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went the drift of the feet of the hurrying
throng.</p>
<p class="poetry">Till all these seemed but one thing, and we
twain another,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A thing frail and feeble and young and unknown;<br
/>
What sign mid all these to tell foeman from brother?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What sign of the hope in our hearts that had
grown?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">We</span> went to our
lodging afar from the river,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And slept and forgot&mdash;and remembered in
dreams;<br />
And friends that I knew not I strove to deliver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From a crowd that swept o&rsquo;er us in measureless
streams,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Wending whither I knew not: till meseemed I was waking<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the first night in London, and lay by my love,<br
/>
And she worn and changed, and my very heart aching<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a terror of soul that forbade me to move.</p>
<p class="poetry">Till I woke, in good sooth, and she lay there
beside me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh, lovely in sleep; but awhile yet I lay,<br />
For the fear of the dream-tide yet seemed to abide me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cold and sad time ere the dawn of the
day.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I went to the window, and saw down below
me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The market-wains wending adown the dim street,<br />
And the scent of the hay and the herbs seemed to know me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seek out my heart the dawn&rsquo;s sorrow to
meet.</p>
<p class="poetry">They passed, and day grew, and with pitiless
faces<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dull houses stared on the prey they had
trapped;<br />
&rsquo;Twas as though they had slain all the fair morning
places<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where in love and in leisure our joyance had
happed.</p>
<p class="poetry">My heart sank; I murmured, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
this we are doing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this grim net of London, this prison built
stark<br />
With the greed of the ages, our young lives pursuing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A phantom that leads but to death in the
dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Day grew, and no longer was dusk with it
striving,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now here and there a few people went by.<br />
As an image of what was once eager and living<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seemed the hope that had led us to live or to
die.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Yet nought else seemed happy; the past and its
pleasure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was light, and unworthy, had been and was gone;<br
/>
If hope had deceived us, if hid were its treasure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nought now would be left us of all life had won.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">love</span>, stand beside
me; the sun is uprisen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first day of London; and shame hath been
here.<br />
For I saw our new life like the bars of a prison,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hope grew a-cold, and I parleyed with fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah!&nbsp; I sadden thy face, and thy grey eyes
are chiding!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, but life is no longer as stories of yore;<br />
From us from henceforth no fair words shall be hiding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nights of the wretched, the days of the
poor.</p>
<p class="poetry">Time was we have grieved, we have feared, we
have faltered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ourselves, for each other, while yet we were
twain;<br />
And no whit of the world by our sorrow was altered,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our faintness grieved nothing, our fear was in
vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now our fear and our faintness, our sorrow, our
passion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall feel all henceforth as we felt it
erewhile;<br />
But now from all this the due deeds we shall fashion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the eyes without blindness, the heart without
guile.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let us grieve then&mdash;and help every soul in
our sorrow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us fear&mdash;and press forward where few dare
to go;<br />
Let us falter in hope&mdash;and plan deeds for the morrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world crowned with freedom, the fall of the
foe.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>As the soldier who goes from his homestead a-weeping,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And whose mouth yet remembers his sweetheart&rsquo;s
embrace,<br />
While all round about him the bullets are sweeping,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But stern and stout-hearted dies there in his
place;</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea, so let our lives be! e&rsquo;en such that
hereafter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the battle is won and the story is told,<br />
Our pain shall be hid, and remembered our laughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And our names shall be those of the bright and the
bold.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;This section had the
following note in <i>The Commonweal</i>.&nbsp; It is the
intention of the author to follow the fortunes of the lovers who
in the &ldquo;Message of the March Wind&rdquo; were already
touched by sympathy with the cause of the people.</p>
<h3><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>III<br
/>
SENDING TO THE WAR</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">It</span> was down in our
far-off village that we heard of the war begun,<br />
But none of the neighbours were in it save the squire&rsquo;s
thick-lipped son,<br />
A youth and a fool and a captain, who came and went away,<br />
And left me glad of his going.&nbsp; There was little for us to
say<br />
Of the war and its why and wherefore&mdash;and we said it often
enough;<br />
The papers gave us our wisdom, and we used it up in the rough.<br
/>
But I held my peace and wondered; for I thought of the folly of
men,<br />
The fair lives ruined and broken that ne&rsquo;er could be mended
again;<br />
And the tale by lies bewildered, and no cause for a man to
choose;<br />
Nothing to curse or to bless&mdash;just a game to win or to
lose.</p>
<p class="poetry">But here were the streets of
London&mdash;strife stalking wide in the world;<br />
And the flag of an ancient people to the battle-breeze
unfurled.<br />
And who was helping or heeding?&nbsp; The gaudy shops
displayed<br />
The toys of rich men&rsquo;s folly, by blinded labour made;<br />
And still from naught to nothing the bright-skinned horses
drew<br />
Dull men and sleek-faced women with never a deed to do;<br />
While all about and around them the street-flood ebbed and
flowed,<br />
Worn feet, grey anxious faces, grey backs bowed &rsquo;neath the
load.<br />
Lo the sons of an ancient people!&nbsp; And for this they fought
and fell<br />
In the days by fame made glorious, in the tale that singers
tell.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>We two we stood in the street in the midst of a mighty
crowd,<br />
The sound of its mingled murmur in the heavens above was loud,<br
/>
And earth was foul with its squalor&mdash;that stream of every
day,<br />
The hurrying feet of labour, the faces worn and grey,<br />
Were a sore and grievous sight, and enough and to spare had I
seen<br />
Of hard and pinching want midst our quiet fields and green;<br />
But all was nothing to this, the London holiday throng.<br />
Dull and with hang-dog gait they stood or shuffled along,<br />
While the stench from the lairs they had lain in last night went
up in the wind,<br />
And poisoned the sun-lit spring: no story men can find<br />
Is fit for the tale of their lives; no word that man hath made<br
/>
Can tell the hue of their faces, or their rags by filth
o&rsquo;er-laid:<br />
For this hath our age invented&mdash;these are the sons of the
free,<br />
Who shall bear our name triumphant o&rsquo;er every land and
sea.<br />
Read ye their souls in their faces, and what shall help you
there?<br />
Joyless, hopeless, shameless, angerless, set is their stare:<br
/>
This is the thing we have made, and what shall help us now,<br />
For the field hath been laboured and tilled and the teeth of the
dragon shall grow.</p>
<p class="poetry">But why are they gathered together? what is
this crowd in the street?<br />
This is a holiday morning, though here and there we meet<br />
The hurrying tradesman&rsquo;s broadcloth, or the workman&rsquo;s
basket of tools.<br />
Men say that at last we are rending the snares of knaves and
fools;<br />
That a cry from the heart of the nation against the foe is
hurled,<br />
And the flag of an ancient people to the battle-breeze
unfurled.<br />
The soldiers are off to the war, we are here to see the sight,<br
/>
And all our griefs shall be hidden by the thought of our
country&rsquo;s might.<br />
&rsquo;Tis the ordered anger of England and her hope for the good
of the Earth<br />
That we to-day are speeding, and many a gift of worth<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Shall
follow the brand and the bullet, and our wrath shall be no
curse,<br />
But a blessing of life to the helpless&mdash;unless we are liars
and worse&mdash;<br />
And these that we see are the senders; these are they that
speed<br />
The dread and the blessing of England to help the world at its
need.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sick unto death was my hope, and I turned and
looked on my dear,<br />
And beheld her frightened wonder, and her grief without a
tear,<br />
And knew how her thought was mine&mdash;when, hark! o&rsquo;er
the hubbub and noise,<br />
Faint and a long way off, the music&rsquo;s measured voice,<br />
And the crowd was swaying and swaying, and somehow, I knew not
why,<br />
A dream came into my heart of deliverance drawing anigh.<br />
Then with roll and thunder of drums grew the music louder and
loud,<br />
And the whole street tumbled and surged, and cleft was the
holiday crowd,<br />
Till two walls of faces and rags lined either side of the way.<br
/>
Then clamour of shouts rose upward, as bright and glittering
gay<br />
Came the voiceful brass of the band, and my heart beat fast and
fast,<br />
For the river of steel came on, and the wrath of England
passed<br />
Through the want and the woe of the town, and strange and wild
was my thought,<br />
And my clenched hands wandered about as though a weapon they
sought.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hubbub and din was behind them, and the
shuffling haggard throng,<br />
Wandering aimless about, tangled the street for long;<br />
But the shouts and the rhythmic noise we still heard far away,<br
/>
And my dream was become a picture of the deeds of another day.<br
/>
Far and far was I borne, away o&rsquo;er the years to come,<br />
And again was the ordered march, and the thunder of the drum,<br
/>
And the bickering points of steel, and the horses shifting
about<br />
&rsquo;Neath the flashing swords of the captains&mdash;then the
silence after the shout&mdash;<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Sun and
wind in the street, familiar things made clear,<br />
Made strange by the breathless waiting for the deeds that are
drawing anear.<br />
For woe had grown into will, and wrath was bared of its
sheath,<br />
And stark in the streets of London stood the crop of the
dragon&rsquo;s teeth.<br />
Where then in my dream were the poor and the wall of faces
wan?<br />
Here and here by my side, shoulder to shoulder of man,<br />
Hope in the simple folk, hope in the hearts of the wise,<br />
For the happy life to follow, or death and the ending of lies,<br
/>
Hope is awake in the faces angerless now no more,<br />
Till the new peace dawn on the world, the fruit of the
people&rsquo;s war.</p>
<p class="poetry">War in the world abroad a thousand leagues
away,<br />
While custom&rsquo;s wheel goes round and day devoureth day.<br
/>
Peace at home!&mdash;what peace, while the rich man&rsquo;s mill
is strife,<br />
And the poor is the grist that he grindeth, and life devoureth
life?</p>

MOTHER AND SON</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Now</span> sleeps the land
of houses, and dead night holds the street,<br />
And there thou liest, my baby, and sleepest soft and sweet;<br />
My man is away for awhile, but safe and alone we lie;<br />
And none heareth thy breath but thy mother, and the moon looking
down from the sky<br />
On the weary waste of the town, as it looked on the grass-edged
road<br />
Still warm with yesterday&rsquo;s sun, when I left my old
abode,<br />
Hand in hand with my love, that night of all nights in the
year;<br />
When the river of love o&rsquo;erflowed and drowned all doubt and
fear,<br />
And we two were alone in the world, and once, if never again,<br
/>
We knew of the secret of earth and the tale of its labour and
pain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lo amidst London I lift thee, and how little
and light thou art,<br />
And thou without hope or fear, thou fear and hope of my heart!<br
/>
Lo here thy body beginning, O son, and thy soul and thy life;<br
/>
But how will it be if thou livest, and enterest into the
strife,<br />
And in love we dwell together when the man is grown in thee,<br
/>
When thy sweet speech I shall hearken, and yet &rsquo;twixt thee
and me<br />
Shall rise that wall of distance, that round each one doth
grow,<br />
And maketh it hard and bitter each other&rsquo;s thought to
know?<br />
Now, therefore, while yet thou art little and hast no thought of
thine own,<br />
I will tell thee a word of the world, of the hope whence thou
hast grown,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Of the love that once begat thee, of the sorrow that
hath made<br />
Thy little heart of hunger, and thy hands on my bosom laid.<br />
Then mayst thou remember hereafter, as whiles when people say<br
/>
All this hath happened before in the life of another day;<br />
So mayst thou dimly remember this tale of thy mother&rsquo;s
voice,<br />
As oft in the calm of dawning I have heard the birds rejoice,<br
/>
As oft I have heard the storm-wind go moaning through the
wood,<br />
And I knew that earth was speaking, and the mother&rsquo;s voice
was good.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, to thee alone will I tell it that thy
mother&rsquo;s body is fair,<br />
In the guise of the country maidens who play with the sun and the
air,<br />
Who have stood in the row of the reapers in the August
afternoon,<br />
Who have sat by the frozen water in the highday of the moon,<br
/>
When the lights of the Christmas feasting were dead in the house
on the hill,<br />
And the wild geese gone to the salt marsh had left the winter
still.<br />
Yea, I am fair, my firstling; if thou couldst but remember me!<br
/>
The hair that thy small hand clutcheth is a goodly sight to
see;<br />
I am true, but my face is a snare; soft and deep are my eyes,<br
/>
And they seem for men&rsquo;s beguiling fulfilled with the dreams
of the wise.<br />
Kind are my lips, and they look as though my soul had learned<br
/>
Deep things I have never heard of.&nbsp; My face and my hands are
burned<br />
By the lovely sun of the acres; three months of London-town<br />
And thy birth-bed have bleached them indeed&mdash;&ldquo;But lo,
where the edge of the gown&rdquo;<br />
(So said thy father one day) &ldquo;parteth the wrist white as
curd<br />
From the brown of the hands that I love, bright as the wing of a
bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Such is thy mother, O firstling, yet strong as
the maidens of old,<br />
Whose spears and whose swords were the warders of homestead, of
field and of fold.<br />
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Oft were
my feet on the highway, often they wearied the grass;<br />
From dusk unto dusk of the summer three times in a week would I
pass<br />
To the downs from the house on the river through the waves of the
blossoming corn.<br />
Fair then I lay down in the even, and fresh I arose on the
morn,<br />
And scarce in the noon was I weary.&nbsp; Ah, son, in the days of
thy strife,<br />
If thy soul could harbour a dream of the blossom of my life!<br
/>
It would be as sunlit meadows beheld from a tossing sea,<br />
And thy soul should look on a vision of the peace that is to
be.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet, yet the tears on my cheek!&nbsp; And what
is this doth move<br />
My heart to thy heart, beloved, save the flood of yearning
love?<br />
For fair and fierce is thy father, and soft and strange are his
eyes<br />
That look on the days that shall be with the hope of the brave
and the wise.<br />
It was many a day that we laughed as over the meadows we
walked,<br />
And many a day I hearkened and the pictures came as he talked;<br
/>
It was many a day that we longed, and we lingered late at eve<br
/>
Ere speech from speech was sundered, and my hand his hand could
leave.<br />
Then I wept when I was alone, and I longed till the daylight
came;<br />
And down the stairs I stole, and there was our housekeeping
dame<br />
(No mother of me, the foundling) kindling the fire betimes<br />
Ere the haymaking folk went forth to the meadows down by the
limes;<br />
All things I saw at a glance; the quickening fire-tongues
leapt<br />
Through the crackling heap of sticks, and the sweet smoke up from
it crept,<br />
And close to the very hearth the low sun flooded the floor,<br />
And the cat and her kittens played in the sun by the open
door.<br />
The garden was fair in the morning, and there in the road he
stood<br />
Beyond the crimson daisies and the bush of southernwood.<br />
Then side by side together through the grey-walled place we
went,<br />
And O the fear departed, and the rest and sweet content!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span><span class="smcap">Son</span>, sorrow and wisdom he
taught me, and sore I grieved and learned<br />
As we twain grew into one; and the heart within me burned<br />
With the very hopes of his heart.&nbsp; Ah, son, it is
piteous,<br />
But never again in my life shall I dare to speak to thee thus;<br
/>
So may these lonely words about thee creep and cling,<br />
These words of the lonely night in the days of our wayfaring.<br
/>
Many a child of woman to-night is born in the town,<br />
The desert of folly and wrong; and of what and whence are they
grown?<br />
Many and many an one of wont and use is born;<br />
For a husband is taken to bed as a hat or a ribbon is worn.<br />
Prudence begets her thousands: &ldquo;Good is a
housekeeper&rsquo;s life,<br />
So shall I sell my body that I may be matron and wife.&rdquo;<br
/>
&ldquo;And I shall endure foul wedlock and bear the children of
need.&rdquo;<br />
Some are there born of hate&mdash;many the children of greed.<br
/>
&ldquo;I, I too can be wedded, though thou my love hast
got.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I am fair and hard of heart, and riches shall be my
lot.&rdquo;<br />
And all these are the good and the happy, on whom the world dawns
fair.<br />
O son, when wilt thou learn of those that are born of despair,<br
/>
As the fabled mud of the Nile that quickens under the sun<br />
With a growth of creeping things, half dead when just begun?<br
/>
E&rsquo;en such is the care of Nature that man should never
die,<br />
Though she breed of the fools of the earth, and the dregs of the
city sty.<br />
But thou, O son, O son, of very love wert born,<br />
When our hope fulfilled bred hope, and fear was a folly
outworn;<br />
On the eve of the toil and the battle all sorrow and grief we
weighed,<br />
We hoped and we were not ashamed, we knew and we were not
afraid.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now waneth the night and the moon&mdash;ah,
son, it is piteous<br />
That never again in my life shall I dare to speak to thee
thus.<br />
But sure from the wise and the simple shall the mighty come to
birth;<br />
And fair were my fate, beloved, if I be yet on the earth<br />
When the world is awaken at last, and from mouth to mouth they
tell<br />
Of thy love and thy deeds and thy valour, and thy hope that
nought can quell.</p>

NEW BIRTH</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">It</span> was twenty-five
years ago that I lay in my mother&rsquo;s lap<br />
New born to life, nor knowing one whit of all that should hap:<br
/>
That day was I won from nothing to the world of struggle and
pain,<br />
Twenty-five years ago&mdash;and to-night am I born again.</p>
<p class="poetry">I look and behold the days of the years that
are passed away,<br />
And my soul is full of their wealth, for oft were they blithe and
gay<br />
As the hours of bird and of beast: they have made me calm and
strong<br />
To wade the stream of confusion, the river of grief and
wrong.</p>
<p class="poetry">A rich man was my father, but he skulked ere I
was born,<br />
And gave my mother money, but left her life to scorn;<br />
And we dwelt alone in our village: I knew not my mother&rsquo;s
&ldquo;shame,&rdquo;<br />
But her love and her wisdom I knew till death and the parting
came.<br />
Then a lawyer paid me money, and I lived awhile at a school,<br
/>
And learned the lore of the ancients, and how the knave and the
fool<br />
Have been mostly the masters of earth: yet the earth seemed fair
and good<br />
With the wealth of field and homestead, and garden and river and
wood;<br />
And I was glad amidst it, and little of evil I knew<br />
As I did in sport and pastime such deeds as a youth might do,<br
/>
Who deems he shall live for ever.&nbsp; Till at last it befel on
a day<br />
That I came across our Frenchman at the edge of the new-mown
hay,<br />
A-fishing as he was wont, alone as he always was;<br />
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>So I
helped the dark old man to bring a chub to grass,<br />
And somehow he knew of my birth, and somehow we came to be
friends,<br />
Till he got to telling me chapters of the tale that never
ends;<br />
The battle of grief and hope with riches and folly and wrong.<br
/>
He told how the weak conspire, he told of the fear of the
strong;<br />
He told of dreams grown deeds, deeds done ere time was ripe,<br
/>
Of hope that melted in air like the smoke of his evening pipe;<br
/>
Of the fight long after hope in the teeth of all despair;<br />
Of battle and prison and death, of life stripped naked and
bare.<br />
But to me it all seemed happy, for I gilded all with the gold<br
/>
Of youth that believes not in death, nor knoweth of hope grown
cold.<br />
I hearkened and learned, and longed with a longing that had no
name,<br />
Till I went my ways to our village and again departure came.</p>
<p class="poetry">Wide now the world was grown, and I saw things
clear and grim,<br />
That awhile agone smiled on me from the dream-mist doubtful and
dim.<br />
I knew that the poor were poor, and had no heart or hope;<br />
And I knew that I was nothing with the least of evils to cope;<br
/>
So I thought the thoughts of a man, and I fell into bitter
mood,<br />
Wherein, except as a picture, there was nought on the earth that
was good;<br />
Till I met the woman I love, and she asked, as folk ask of the
wise,<br />
Of the root and meaning of things that she saw in the world of
lies.<br />
I told her all I knew, and the tale told lifted the load<br />
That made me less than a man; and she set my feet on the
road.</p>
<p class="poetry">So we left our pleasure behind to seek for hope
and for life,<br />
And to London we came, if perchance there smouldered the embers
of strife<br />
Such as our Frenchman had told of; and I wrote to him to ask<br
/>
If he would be our master, and set the learners their task.<br />
But &ldquo;dead&rdquo; was the word on the letter when it came
back to me,<br />
And all that we saw henceforward with our own eyes must we
see.<br />
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>So we
looked and wondered and sickened; not for ourselves indeed:<br />
My father by now had died, but he left enough for my need;<br />
And besides, away in our village the joiner&rsquo;s craft had I
learned,<br />
And I worked as other men work, and money and wisdom I earned.<br
/>
Yet little from day to day in street or workshop I met<br />
To nourish the plant of hope that deep in my heart had been
set.<br />
The life of the poor we learned, and to me there was nothing
new<br />
In their day of little deeds that ever deathward drew.<br />
But new was the horror of London that went on all the while<br />
That rich men played at their ease for name and fame to
beguile<br />
The days of their empty lives, and praised the deeds they did,<br
/>
As though they had fashioned the earth and found out the sun long
hid;<br />
Though some of them busied themselves from hopeless day to day<br
/>
With the lives of the slaves of the rich and the hell wherein
they lay.<br />
They wrought meseems as those who should make a bargain with
hell,<br />
That it grow a little cooler, and thus for ever to dwell.</p>
<p class="poetry">So passed the world on its ways, and weary with
waiting we were.<br />
Men ate and drank and married; no wild cry smote the air,<br />
No great crowd ran together to greet the day of doom;<br />
And ever more and more seemed the town like a monstrous tomb<br
/>
To us, the Pilgrims of Hope, until to-night it came,<br />
And Hope on the stones of the street is written in letters of
flame.</p>
<p class="poetry">This is how it befel: a workmate of mine had
heard<br />
Some bitter speech in my mouth, and he took me up at the word,<br
/>
And said: &ldquo;Come over to-morrow to our Radical
spouting-place;<br />
For there, if we hear nothing new, at least we shall see a new
face;<br />
He is one of those Communist chaps, and &rsquo;tis like that you
two may agree.&rdquo;<br />
So we went, and the street was as dull and as common as aught you
could see;<br />
Dull and dirty the room.&nbsp; Just over the chairman&rsquo;s
chair<br />
Was a bust, a Quaker&rsquo;s face with nose cocked up in the
air;<br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>There were
common prints on the wall of the heads of the party fray,<br />
And Mazzini dark and lean amidst them gone astray.<br />
Some thirty men we were of the kind that I knew full well,<br />
Listless, rubbed down to the type of our easy-going hell.<br />
My heart sank down as I entered, and wearily there I sat<br />
While the chairman strove to end his maunder of this and of
that.<br />
And partly shy he seemed, and partly indeed ashamed<br />
Of the grizzled man beside him as his name to us he named.<br />
He rose, thickset and short, and dressed in shabby blue,<br />
And even as he began it seemed as though I knew<br />
The thing he was going to say, though I never heard it before.<br
/>
He spoke, were it well, were it ill, as though a message he
bore,<br />
A word that he could not refrain from many a million of men.<br
/>
Nor aught seemed the sordid room and the few that were listening
then<br />
Save the hall of the labouring earth and the world which was to
be.<br />
Bitter to many the message, but sweet indeed unto me,<br />
Of man without a master, and earth without a strife,<br />
And every soul rejoicing in the sweet and bitter of life:<br />
Of peace and good-will he told, and I knew that in faith he
spake,<br />
But his words were my very thoughts, and I saw the battle
awake,<br />
And I followed from end to end; and triumph grew in my heart<br
/>
As he called on each that heard him to arise and play his part<br
/>
In the tale of the new-told gospel, lest as slaves they should
live and die.</p>
<p class="poetry">He ceased, and I thought the hearers would rise
up with one cry,<br />
And bid him straight enrol them; but they, they applauded
indeed,<br />
For the man was grown full eager, and had made them hearken and
heed:<br />
But they sat and made no sign, and two of the glibber kind<br />
Stood up to jeer and to carp his fiery words to blind.<br />
I did not listen to them, but failed not his voice to hear<br />
When he rose to answer the carpers, striving to make more
clear<br />
That which was clear already; not overwell, I knew,<br />
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>He
answered the sneers and the silence, so hot and eager he grew;<br
/>
But my hope full well he answered, and when he called again<br />
On men to band together lest they live and die in vain,<br />
In fear lest he should escape me, I rose ere the meeting was
done,<br />
And gave him my name and my faith&mdash;and I was the only
one.<br />
He smiled as he heard the jeers, and there was a shake of the
hand,<br />
He spoke like a friend long known; and lo! I was one of the
band.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now the streets seem gay and the high stars
glittering bright;<br />
And for me, I sing amongst them, for my heart is full and
light.<br />
I see the deeds to be done and the day to come on the earth,<br
/>
And riches vanished away and sorrow turned to mirth;<br />
I see the city squalor and the country stupor gone.<br />
And we a part of it all&mdash;we twain no longer alone<br />
In the days to come of the pleasure, in the days that are of the
fight&mdash;<br />
I was born once long ago: I am born again to-night.</p>

THE NEW PROLETARIAN</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">How</span> near to the goal
are we now, and what shall we live to behold?<br />
Will it come a day of surprise to the best of the hopeful and
bold?<br />
Shall the sun arise some morning and see men falling to work,<br
/>
Smiling and loving their lives, not fearing the ill that may
lurk<br />
In every house on their road, in the very ground that they
tread?<br />
Shall the sun see famine slain, and the fear of children dead?<br
/>
Shall he look adown on men set free from the burden of care,<br
/>
And the earth grown like to himself, so comely, clean and
fair?<br />
Or else will it linger and loiter, till hope deferred hath
spoiled<br />
All bloom of the life of man&mdash;yea, the day for which we have
toiled?<br />
Till our hearts be turned to stone by the griefs that we have
borne,<br />
And our loving kindness seared by love from our anguish torn.<br
/>
Till our hope grow a wrathful fire, and the light of the second
birth<br />
Be a flame to burn up the weeds from the lean impoverished
earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">What&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Meseems it was but a
little while ago<br />
When the merest sparkle of hope set all my heart aglow!<br />
The hope of the day was enough; but now &rsquo;tis the very
day<br />
That wearies my hope with longing.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s changed or
gone away?<br />
Or what is it drags at my heart-strings?&mdash;is it aught save
the coward&rsquo;s fear?<br />
In this little room where I sit is all that I hold most
dear&mdash;<br />
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>My love,
and the love we have fashioned, my wife and the little lad.<br />
Yet the four walls look upon us with other eyes than they had,<br

For indeed a thing hath happened.&nbsp; Last week at my craft I
worked,<br />
Lest oft in the grey of the morning my heart should tell me I
shirked;<br />
But to-day I work for us three, lest he and she and I<br />
In the mud of the street should draggle till we come to the
workhouse or die.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not long to tell is the story, for, as I told
you before,<br />
A lawyer paid me the money which came from my father&rsquo;s
store.<br />
Well, now the lawyer is dead, and a curious tangle of theft,<br

It seems, is what he has lived by, and none of my money is
left.<br />
So I who have worked for my pleasure now work for utter need:<br

In &ldquo;the noble army of labour&rdquo; I now am a soldier
indeed.</p>

that I hearken to hear,<br />
Nor heed the laughter much; have patience a little while,<br />
I will tell you what&rsquo;s in my heart, nor hide a jot by
guile.<br />
When I worked pretty much for my pleasure I really worked with a
will,<br />
It was well and workmanlike done, and my fellows knew my
skill,<br />
And deemed me one of themselves though they called me gentleman
Dick,<br />
Since they knew I had some money; but now that to work I must
stick,<br />
Or fall into utter ruin, there&rsquo;s something gone, I find;<br
/>
The work goes, cleared is the job, but there&rsquo;s something
left behind;<br />
I take up fear with my chisel, fear lies &rsquo;twixt me and my
plane,<br />
And I wake in the merry morning to a new unwonted pain.<br />
That&rsquo;s fear: I shall live it down&mdash;and many a thing
besides<br />
Till I win the poor dulled heart which the workman&rsquo;s jacket
hides.<br />
Were it not for the Hope of Hopes I know my journey&rsquo;s
end,<br />
And would wish I had ne&rsquo;er been born the weary way to
wend.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Now further, well you may think we have lived no
gentleman&rsquo;s life,<br />
My wife is my servant, and I am the servant of my wife,<br />
And we make no work for each other; but country folk we were,<br
/>
And she sickened sore for the grass and the breath of the
fragrant air<br />
That had made her lovely and strong; and so up here we came<br />
To the northern slopes of the town to live with a country
dame,<br />
Who can talk of the field-folks&rsquo; ways: not one of the
newest the house,<br />
The woodwork worn to the bone, its panels the land of the
mouse,<br />
Its windows rattling and loose, its floors all up and down;<br />
But this at least it was, just a cottage left in the town.<br />
There might you sit in our parlour in the Sunday afternoon<br />
And watch the sun through the vine-leaves and fall to dreaming
that soon<br />
You would see the grey team passing, their fetlocks wet with the
brook,<br />
Or the shining mountainous straw-load: there the summer moon
would look<br />
Through the leaves on the lampless room, wherein we sat we
twain,<br />
All London vanished away; and the morn of the summer rain<br />
Would waft us the scent of the hay; or the first faint yellow
leaves<br />
Would flutter adown before us and tell of the acres of
sheaves.</p>
<p class="poetry">All this hath our lawyer eaten, and to-morrow
must we go<br />
To a room near my master&rsquo;s shop, in the purlieus of
Soho.<br />
No words of its shabby meanness!&nbsp; But that is our
prison-cell<br />
In the jail of weary London.&nbsp; Therein for us must dwell<br
/>
The hope of the world that shall be, that rose a glimmering
spark<br />
As the last thin flame of our pleasure sank quavering in the
dark.</p>
<p class="poetry">Again the rich man jeereth: &ldquo;The man is a
coward, or worse&mdash;<br />
He bewails his feeble pleasure; he quails before the curse<br />
Which many a man endureth with calm and smiling face.&rdquo;<br
/>
Nay, the man is a man, by your leave!&nbsp; Or put yourself in
his place,<br />
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>And see if
the tale reads better.&nbsp; The haven of rest destroyed,<br />
And nothing left of the life that was once so well enjoyed<br />
But leave to live and labour, and the glimmer of hope
deferred.<br />
Now know I the cry of the poor no more as a story heard,<br />
But rather a wordless wail forced forth from the weary heart.<br
/>
Now, now when hope ariseth I shall surely know my part.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There&rsquo;s</span> a
little more to tell.&nbsp; When those last words were said,<br />
At least I was yet a-working, and earning daily bread.<br />
But now all that is changed, and meseems adown the stair<br />
That leads to the nethermost pit, man, wife and child must
fare.</p>
<p class="poetry">When I joined the Communist folk, I did what in
me lay<br />
To learn the grounds of their faith.&nbsp; I read day after
day<br />
Whatever books I could handle, and heard about and about<br />
What talk was going amongst them; and I burned up doubt after
doubt,<br />
Until it befel at last that to others I needs must speak<br />
(Indeed, they pressed me to that while yet I was weaker than
weak).<br />
So I began the business, and in street-corners I spake<br />
To knots of men.&nbsp; Indeed, that made my very heart ache,<br
/>
So hopeless it seemed; for some stood by like men of wood;<br />
And some, though fain to listen, but a few words understood;<br
/>
And some but hooted and jeered: but whiles across some I came<br
/>
Who were keen and eager to hear; as in dry flax the flame<br />
So the quick thought flickered amongst them: and that indeed was
a feast.<br />
So about the streets I went, and the work on my hands
increased;<br />
And to say the very truth betwixt the smooth and the rough<br />
It was work and hope went with it, and I liked it well enough:<br
/>
Nor made I any secret of all that I was at<br />
But daily talked in our shop and spoke of this and of that.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Then vanished my money away, and like a fool I told<br
/>
Some one or two of the loss.&nbsp; Did that make the master
bold?<br />
Before I was one of his lot, and as queer as my head might be<br
/>
I might do pretty much as I liked.&nbsp; Well now he sent for
me<br />
And spoke out in very words my thought of the rich man&rsquo;s
jeer:<br />
&ldquo;Well, sir, you have got your wish, as far as I can
hear,<br />
And are now no thief of labour, but an honest working man:<br />
Now I&rsquo;ll give you a word of warning: stay in it as long as
you can,<br />
This working lot that you like so: you&rsquo;re pretty well off
as you are.<br />
So take another warning: I have thought you went too far,<br />
And now I am quite sure of it; so make an end of your talk<br />
At once and for ever henceforth, or out of my shop you walk;<br
/>
There are plenty of men to be had who are quite as good as
you.<br />
And mind you, anywhere else you&rsquo;ll scarce get work to
do,<br />
Unless you rule your tongue;&mdash;good morning; stick to your
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The hot blood rose to my eyes, somewhere a
thought did lurk<br />
To finish both him and the job: but I knew now what I was,<br />
And out of the little office in helpless rage did I pass<br />
And went to my work, a <i>slave</i>, for the sake of my child and
my sweet.<br />
Did men look for the brand on my forehead that eve as I went
through the street?<br />
And what was the end after all?&nbsp; Why, one of my shopmates
heard<br />
My next night&rsquo;s speech in the street, and passed on some
bitter word,<br />
And that week came a word with my money: &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t
come again.&rdquo;<br />
And the shame of my four days&rsquo; silence had been but grief
in vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Well I see the days before me: this time we
shall not die<br />
Nor go to the workhouse at once: I shall get work by-and-by,<br
/>
And shall work in fear at first, and at last forget my fear,<br
/>
And drudge on from day to day, since it seems that I hold life
dear.<br />
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>&rsquo;Tis
the lot of many millions!&nbsp; Yet if half of those millions
knew<br />
The hope that my heart hath learned, we should find a deed to
do,<br />
And who or what should withstand us?&nbsp; And I, e&rsquo;en I
might live<br />
To know the love of my fellows and the gifts that earth can
give.</p>

IN PRISON&mdash;AND AT HOME</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> first of the
nights is this, and I cannot go to bed;<br />
I long for the dawning sorely, although when the night shall be
dead,<br />
Scarce to me shall the day be alive.&nbsp; Twice twenty-eight
nights more,<br />
Twice twenty-eight long days till the evil dream be
o&rsquo;er!<br />
And he, does he count the hours as he lies in his prison-cell?<br
/>
Does he nurse and cherish his pain?&nbsp; Nay, I know his strong
heart well,<br />
Swift shall his soul fare forth; he is here, and bears me
away,<br />
Till hand in hand we depart toward the hope of the earlier
day.<br />
Yea, here or there he sees it: in the street, in the cell, he
sees<br />
The vision he made me behold mid the stems of the blossoming
trees,<br />
When spring lay light on the earth, and first and at last I
knew<br />
How sweet was his clinging hand, how fair were the deeds he would
do.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, how wilt thou weep and be soft and cherish
a pleasure in pain,<br />
When the days and their task are before thee and awhile thou must
work for twain?<br />
O face, thou shalt lose yet more of thy fairness, be thinner no
doubt,<br />
And be waxen white and worn by the day that he cometh out!<br />
Hand, how pale thou shalt be! how changed from the sunburnt
hand<br />
That he kissed as it handled the rake in the noon of the summer
land!</p>
<p class="poetry">Let me think then it is but a trifle: the
neighbours have told me so;<br />
&ldquo;Two months! why that is nothing and the time will speedily
go.&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>&rsquo;Tis
nothing&mdash;O empty bed, let me work then for his sake!<br />
I will copy out the paper which he thought the News might
take,<br />
If my eyes may see the letters; &rsquo;tis a picture of our
life<br />
And the little deeds of our days ere we thought of prison and
strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, neighbour, yes I am early&mdash;and I was
late last night;<br />
Bedless I wore through the hours and made a shift to write.<br />
It was kind of you to come, nor will it grieve me at all<br />
To tell you why he&rsquo;s in prison and how the thing did
befal;<br />
For I know you are with us at heart, and belike will join us
soon.<br />
It was thus: we went to a meeting on Saturday afternoon,<br />
At a new place down in the West, a wretched quarter enough,<br />
Where the rich men&rsquo;s houses are elbowed by ragged streets
and rough,<br />
Which are worse than they seem to be.&nbsp; (Poor thing! you know
too well<br />
How pass the days and the nights within that bricken hell!)<br />
There, then, on a bit of waste we stood &rsquo;twixt the rich and
the poor;<br />
And Jack was the first to speak; that was he that you met at the
door<br />
Last week.&nbsp; It was quiet at first; and dull they most of
them stood<br />
As though they heeded nothing, nor thought of bad or of good,<br
/>
Not even that they were poor, and haggard and dirty and dull:<br
/>
Nay, some were so rich indeed that they with liquor were full,<br
/>
And dull wrath rose in their souls as the hot words went by their
ears,<br />
For they deemed they were mocked and rated by men that were more
than their peers.<br />
But for some, they seemed to think that a prelude was all this<br
/>
To the preachment of saving of souls, and hell, and endless
bliss;<br />
While some (O the hearts of slaves!) although they might
understand,<br />
When they heard their masters and feeders called thieves of
wealth and of land,<br />
Were as angry as though <i>they</i> were cursed.&nbsp; Withal
there were some that heard,<br />
And stood and pondered it all, and garnered a hope and a word.<br
/>
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Ah! heavy
my heart was grown as I gazed on the terrible throng.<br />
Lo! these that should have been the glad and the deft and the
strong,<br />
How were they dull and abased as the very filth of the road!<br
/>
And who should waken their souls or clear their hearts of the
load?</p>
<p class="poetry">The crowd was growing and growing, and
therewith the jeering grew;<br />
And now that the time was come for an ugly brawl I knew,<br />
When I saw how midst of the workmen some well-dressed men there
came,<br />
Of the scum of the well-to-do, brutes void of pity or shame;<br
/>
The thief is a saint beside them.&nbsp; These raised a jeering
noise,<br />
And our speaker quailed before it, and the hubbub drowned his
voice.<br />
Then Richard put him aside and rose at once in his place,<br />
And over the rags and the squalor beamed out his beautiful
face,<br />
And his sweet voice rang through the tumult, and I think the
crowd would have hushed<br />
And hearkened his manly words; but a well-dressed reptile
pushed<br />
Right into the ring about us and screeched out infamies<br />
That sickened the soul to hearken; till he caught my angry
eyes<br />
And my voice that cried out at him, and straight on me he
turned,<br />
A foul word smote my heart and his cane on my shoulders
burned.<br />
But e&rsquo;en as a kestrel stoops down Richard leapt from his
stool<br />
And drave his strong right hand amidst the mouth of the fool.<br
/>
Then all was mingled together, and away from him was I torn,<br
/>
And, hustled hither and thither, on the surging crowd was
borne;<br />
But at last I felt my feet, for the crowd began to thin,<br />
And I looked about for Richard that away from thence we might
win;<br />
When lo, the police amidst us, and Richard hustled along<br />
Betwixt a pair of blue-coats as the doer of all the wrong!</p>
<p class="poetry">Little longer, friend, is the story; I scarce
have seen him again;<br />
I could not get him bail despite my trouble and pain;<br />
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>And this
morning he stood in the dock: for all that that might avail,<br
/>
They might just as well have dragged him at once to the destined
jail.<br />
The police had got their man and they meant to keep him there,<br
/>
And whatever tale was needful they had no trouble to swear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Well, the white-haired fool on the bench was
busy it seems that day,<br />
And so with the words &ldquo;Two months,&rdquo; he swept the case
away;<br />
Yet he lectured my man ere he went, but not for the riot
indeed<br />
For which he was sent to prison, but for holding a dangerous
creed.<br />
&ldquo;What have you got to do to preach such perilous stuff?<br
/>
To take some care of yourself should find you work enough.<br />
If you needs must preach or lecture, then hire a chapel or
hall;<br />
Though indeed if you take my advice you&rsquo;ll just preach
nothing at all,<br />
But stick to your work: you seem clever; who knows but you might
rise,<br />
And become a little builder should you condescend to be wise?<br
/>
For in spite of your silly sedition, the land that we live in is
free,<br />
And opens a pathway to merit for you as well as for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, friend, am I grown light-headed with the
lonely grief of the night,<br />
That I babble of this babble?&nbsp; Woe&rsquo;s me, how little
and light<br />
Is this beginning of trouble to all that yet shall be
borne&mdash;<br />
At worst but as the shower that lays but a yard of the corn<br />
Before the hailstorm cometh and flattens the field to the
earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">O for a word from my love of the hope of the
second birth!<br />
Could he clear my vision to see the sword creeping out of the
sheath<br />
Inch by inch as we writhe in the toils of our living death!<br />
Could he but strengthen my heart to know that we cannot fail;<br
/>
For alas, I am lonely here&mdash;helpless and feeble and
frail;<br />
I am e&rsquo;en as the poor of the earth, e&rsquo;en they that
are now alive;<br />
And where is their might and their cunning with the mighty of men
to strive?<br />
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Though
they that come after be strong to win the day and the crown,<br
/>
Ah, ever must we the deedless to the deedless dark go down,<br />
Still crying, &ldquo;To-morrow, to-morrow, to-morrow yet shall
be<br />
The new-born sun&rsquo;s arising o&rsquo;er happy earth and
sea&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
And we not there to greet it&mdash;for to-day and its life we
yearn,<br />
And where is the end of toiling and whitherward now shall we
turn<br />
But to patience, ever patience, and yet and yet to bear;<br />
And yet, forlorn, unanswered as oft before to hear,<br />
Through the tales of the ancient fathers and the dreams that mock
our wrong,<br />
That cry to the naked heavens, &ldquo;How long, O Lord! how
long?&rdquo;</p>

THE HALF OF LIFE GONE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> days have slain
the days, and the seasons have gone by<br />
And brought me the summer again; and here on the grass I lie<br
/>
As erst I lay and was glad ere I meddled with right and with
wrong.<br />
Wide lies the mead as of old, and the river is creeping along<br
/>
By the side of the elm-clad bank that turns its weedy stream,<br
/>
And grey o&rsquo;er its hither lip the quivering rushes gleam.<br
/>
There is work in the mead as of old; they are eager at winning
the hay,<br />
While every sun sets bright and begets a fairer day.<br />
The forks shine white in the sun round the yellow red-wheeled
wain,<br />
Where the mountain of hay grows fast; and now from out of the
lane<br />
Comes the ox-team drawing another, comes the bailiff and the
beer,<br />
And thump, thump, goes the farmer&rsquo;s nag o&rsquo;er the
narrow bridge of the weir.<br />
High up and light are the clouds, and though the swallows flit<br
/>
So high o&rsquo;er the sunlit earth, they are well a part of
it,<br />
And so, though high over them, are the wings of the wandering
herne;<br />
In measureless depths above him doth the fair sky quiver and
burn;<br />
The dear sun floods the land as the morning falls toward noon,<br
/>
And a little wind is awake in the best of the latter June.</p>
<p class="poetry">They are busy winning the hay, and the life and
the picture they make,<br />
If I were as once I was, I should deem it made for my sake;<br />
For here if one need not work is a place for happy rest,<br />
While one&rsquo;s thought wends over the world, north, south, and
east and west.<br />
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>There are
the men and the maids, and the wives and the gaffers grey<br />
Of the fields I know so well, and but little changed are they<br
/>
Since I was a lad amongst them; and yet how great is the
change!<br />
Strange are they grown unto me; yea, I to myself am strange.<br
/>
Their talk and their laughter mingling with the music of the
meads<br />
Has now no meaning to me to help or to hinder my needs,<br />
So far from them have I drifted.&nbsp; And yet amidst them
goes<br />
A part of myself, my boy, and of pleasure and pain he knows,<br
/>
And deems it something strange when he is other than glad.<br />
Lo now! the woman that stoops and kisses the face of the lad,<br
/>
And puts a rake in his hand and laughs in his laughing
face&mdash;<br />
Whose is the voice that laughs in the old familiar place?<br />
Whose should it be but my love&rsquo;s, if my love were yet on
the earth?<br />
Could she refrain from the fields where my joy and her joy had
birth,<br />
When I was there and her child, on the grass that knew her
feet<br />
Mid the flowers that led her on when the summer eve was
sweet?</p>
<p class="poetry">No, no, it is she no longer; never again can
she come<br />
And behold the hay-wains creeping o&rsquo;er the meadows of her
home;<br />
No more can she kiss her son or put the rake in his hand<br />
That she handled a while agone in the midst of the haymaking
band.<br />
Her laughter is gone and her life; there is no such thing on the
earth,<br />
No share for me then in the stir, no share in the hurry and
mirth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay, let me look and believe that all these
will vanish away,<br />
At least when the night has fallen, and that she will be there
mid the hay,<br />
Happy and weary with work, waiting and longing for love.<br />
There will she be, as of old, when the great moon hung above,<br
/>
And lightless and dead was the village, and nought but the weir
was awake;<br />
There will she rise to meet me, and my hands will she hasten to
take,<br />
And thence shall we wander away, and over the ancient bridge<br
/>
By many a rose-hung hedgerow, till we reach the sun-burnt
ridge<br />
<a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>And the
great trench digged by the Romans: there then awhile shall we
stand,<br />
To watch the dawn come creeping o&rsquo;er the fragrant lovely
land,<br />
Till all the world awaketh, and draws us down, we twain,<br />
To the deeds of the field and the fold and the merry
summer&rsquo;s gain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah thus, only thus shall I see her, in dreams
of the day or the night,<br />
When my soul is beguiled of its sorrow to remember past
delight.<br />
She is gone.&nbsp; She was and she is not; there is no such thing
on the earth<br />
But e&rsquo;en as a picture painted; and for me there is void and
dearth<br />
That I cannot name or measure.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet for me and all these she died,<br />
E&rsquo;en as she lived for awhile, that the better day might
betide.<br />
Therefore I live, and I shall live till the last day&rsquo;s work
shall fail.<br />
Have patience now but a little and I will tell you the tale<br />
Of how and why she died, and why I am weak and worn,<br />
And have wandered away to the meadows and the place where I was
born:<br />
But here and to-day I cannot; for ever my thought will stray<br
/>
To that hope fulfilled for a little and the bliss of the earlier
day.<br />
Of the great world&rsquo;s hope and anguish to-day I scarce can
think:<br />
Like a ghost from the lives of the living and their earthly deeds
I shrink.<br />
I will go adown by the water and over the ancient bridge,<br />
And wend in our footsteps of old till I come to the sun-burnt
ridge,<br />
And the great trench digged by the Romans; and thence awhile will
I gaze,<br />
And see three teeming counties stretch out till they fade in the
haze;<br />
And in all the dwellings of man that thence mine eyes shall
see,<br />
What man as hapless as I am beneath the sun shall be?</p>
<p class="poetry">O fool, what words are these?&nbsp; Thou hast a
sorrow to nurse,<br />
And thou hast been bold and happy; but these, if they utter a
curse,<br />
No sting it has and no meaning&mdash;it is empty sound on the
air.<br />
Thy life is full of mourning, and theirs so empty and bare<br />
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>That they
have no words of complaining; nor so happy have they been<br />
That they may measure sorrow or tell what grief may mean.<br />
And thou, thou hast deeds to do, and toil to meet thee soon;<br

Depart and ponder on these through the sun-worn afternoon.</p>

A NEW FRIEND</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">have</span> promised to
tell you the story of how I was left alone<br />
Sick and wounded and sore, and why the woman is gone<br />
That I deemed a part of my life.&nbsp; Tell me when all is
told,<br />
If you deem it fit that the earth, that the world of men should
hold<br />
My work and my weariness still; yet think of that other life,<br
/>
The child of me and of her, and the years and the coming
strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">After I came out of prison our living was hard
to earn<br />
By the work of my hands, and of hers; to shifts we had to
turn,<br />
Such as the poor know well, and the rich cannot understand,<br />
And just out of the gutter we stood, still loving and hand in
hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">Do you ask me if still amidst all I held the
hunt in view,<br />
And the hope of the morning of life, all the things I should do
and undo?<br />
Be easy, I am not a coward: nay little prudence I learned,<br />
I spoke and I suffered for speaking, and my meat by my manhood
was burned.<br />
When the poor man thinks&mdash;and rebels, the whip lies ready
anear;<br />
But he who is rebel and rich may live safe for many a year,<br />
While he warms his heart with pictures of all the glory to
come.<br />
There&rsquo;s the storm of the press and the critics maybe, but
sweet is his home,<br />
There is meat in the morn and the even, and rest when the day is
done,<br />
All is fair and orderly there as the rising and setting
sun&mdash;<br />
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>And I know
both the rich and the poor.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I grew
bitter they said;<br />
&rsquo;Tis not unlike that I did, for bitter indeed was my
bread,<br />
And surely the nursling plant shall smack of its nourishing
soil.<br />
And here was our life in short, pinching and worry and toil,<br
/>
One petty fear thrust out by another come in its place,<br />
Each scrap of life but a fear, and the sum of it wretched and
base.<br />
E&rsquo;en so fare millions of men, where men for money are
made,<br />
Where the poor are dumb and deedless, where the rich are not
afraid.<br />
Ah, am I bitter again?&nbsp; Well, these are our
breeding-stock,<br />
The very base of order, and the state&rsquo;s foundation rock;<br
/>
Is it so good and so safe that their manhood should be outworn<br
/>
By the struggle for anxious life, the dull pain dismally
borne,<br />
Till all that was man within them is dead and vanished away?<br
/>
Were it not even better that all these should think on a day<br
/>
As they look on each other&rsquo;s sad faces, and see how many
they are:<br />
&ldquo;What are these tales of old time of men who were mighty in
war?<br />
They fought for some city&rsquo;s dominion, for the name of a
forest or field;<br />
They fell that no alien&rsquo;s token should be blazoned on their
shield;<br />
And for this is their valour praised and dear is their renown,<br
/>
And their names are beloved for ever and they wear the
patriot&rsquo;s crown;<br />
And shall we then wait in the streets and this heap of misery,<br
/>
Till their stones rise up to help us or the far heavens set us
free?<br />
For we, we shall fight for no name, no blazon on banner or
shield;<br />
But that man to man may hearken and the earth her increase
yield;<br />
That never again in the world may be sights like we have seen;<br
/>
That never again in the world may be men like we have been,<br />
That never again like ours may be manhood spoilt and
blurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea even so was I bitter, and this was my
evilest word:<br />
&ldquo;Spend and be spent for our hope, and you at least shall be
free,<br />
Though you be rugged and coarse, as wasted and worn as you
be.&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Well,
&ldquo;bitter&rdquo; I was, and denounced, and scarcely at last
might we stand<br />
From out of the very gutter, as we wended hand in hand.<br />
I had written before for the papers, but so &ldquo;bitter&rdquo;
was I grown,<br />
That none of them now would have me that could pay me
half-a-crown,<br />
And the worst seemed closing around us; when as it needs must
chance,<br />
I spoke at some Radical Club of the Great Revolution in
France.<br />
Indeed I said nothing new to those who had learned it all,<br />
And yet as something strange on some of the folk did it fall.<br
/>
It was late in the terrible war, and France to the end drew
nigh,<br />
And some of us stood agape to see how the war would die,<br />
And what would spring from its ashes.&nbsp; So when the talk was
o&rsquo;er<br />
And after the stir and excitement I felt the burden I bore<br />
Heavier yet for it all, there came to speak to me<br />
A serious well-dressed man, a &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; young I
could see;<br />
And we fell to talk together, and he shyly gave me praise,<br />
And asked, though scarcely in words, of my past and my
&ldquo;better days.&rdquo;<br />
Well, there,&mdash;I let it all out, and I flushed as I strode
along,<br />
(For we were walking by now) and bitterly spoke of the wrong.<br
/>
Maybe I taught him something, but ready he was to learn,<br />
And had come to our workmen meetings some knowledge of men to
learn.<br />
He kindled afresh at my words, although to try him I spake<br />
More roughly than I was wont; but every word did he take<br />
For what it was really worth, nor even laughter he spared,<br />
As though he would look on life of its rags of habit bared.</p>
<p class="poetry">Well, why should I be ashamed that he helped me
at my need?<br />
My wife and my child, must I kill them?&nbsp; And the man was a
friend indeed,<br />
And the work that he got me I did (it was writing, you
understand)<br />
As well as another might do it.&nbsp; To be short, he joined our
band<br />
Before many days were over, and we saw him everywhere<br />
That we workmen met together, though I brought him not to my
lair.<br />
Eager he grew for the Cause, and we twain grew friend and
friend:<br />
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>He was
dainty of mind and of body; most brave, as he showed in the
end;<br />
Merry despite of his sadness, quick-witted and speedy to see:<br
/>
Like a perfect knight of old time as the poets would have them to
be.<br />
That was the friend that I won by my bitter speech at last.<br />
He loved me; he grieved my soul: now the love and the grief are
past;<br />
He is gone with his eager learning, his sadness and his mirth,<br
/>
His hope and his fond desire.&nbsp; There is no such thing on the
earth.<br />
He died not unbefriended&mdash;nor unbeloved maybe.<br />
Betwixt my life and his longing there rolls a boundless sea.<br
/>
And what are those memories now to all that I have to do,<br />
The deeds to be done so many, the days of my life so few?</p>
<h3><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>X<br

READY TO DEPART</h3>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">said</span> of my friend
new-found that at first he saw not my lair;<br />
Yet he and I and my wife were together here and there;<br />
And at last as my work increased and my den to a dwelling
grew,<br />
He came there often enough, and yet more together we drew.<br />
Then came a change in the man; for a month he kept away,<br />
Then came again and was with us for a fortnight every day,<br />
But often he sat there silent, which was little his wont with
us.<br />
And at first I had no inkling of what constrained him thus;<br />
I might have thought that he faltered, but now and again there
came,<br />
When we spoke of the Cause and its doings, a flash of his eager
flame,<br />
And he seemed himself for a while; then the brightness would fade
away,<br />
And he gloomed and shrank from my eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus passed day
after day,<br />
And grieved I grew, and I pondered: till at last one eve we
sat<br />
In the fire-lit room together, and talked of this and that,<br />
But chiefly indeed of the war and what would come of it;<br />
For Paris drew near to its fall, and wild hopes &rsquo;gan to
flit<br />
Amidst us Communist folk; and we talked of what might be done<br
/>
When the Germans had gone their ways and the two were left
alone,<br />
Betrayers and betrayed in war-worn wasted France.</p>
<p class="poetry">As I spoke the word &ldquo;betrayed,&rdquo; my
eyes met his in a glance,<br />
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>And
swiftly he turned away; then back with a steady gaze<br />
He turned on me; and it seemed as when a sword-point plays<br />
Round the sword in a battle&rsquo;s beginning and the coming on
of strife.<br />
For I knew though he looked on me, he saw not me, but my wife:<br
/>
And he reddened up to the brow, and the tumult of the blood<br />
Nigh blinded my eyes for a while, that I scarce saw bad or
good,<br />
Till I knew that he was arisen and had gone without a word.<br />
Then I turned about unto her, and a quivering voice I heard<br />
Like music without a meaning, and twice I heard my name.<br />
&ldquo;O Richard, Richard!&rdquo; she said, and her arms about me
came,<br />
And her tears and the lips that I loved were on my face once
more.<br />
A while I clung to her body, and longing sweet and sore<br />
Beguiled my heart of its sorrow; then we sundered and sore she
wept,<br />
While fair pictures of days departed about my sad heart crept,<br
/>
And mazed I felt and weary.&nbsp; But we sat apart again,<br />
Not speaking, while between us was the sharp and bitter pain<br
/>
As the sword &rsquo;twixt the lovers bewildered in the fruitless
marriage bed.<br />
Yet a while, and we spoke together, and I scarce knew what I
said,<br />
But it was not wrath or reproaching, or the chill of love-born
hate;<br />
For belike around and about us, we felt the brooding fate.<br />
We were gentle and kind together, and if any had seen us so,<br
/>
They had said, &ldquo;These two are one in the face of all
trouble and woe.&rdquo;<br />
But indeed as a wedded couple we shrank from the eyes of men,<br
/>
As we dwelt together and pondered on the days that come not
again.</p>
<p class="poetry">Days passed and we dwelt together; nor Arthur
came for awhile;<br />
Gravely it was and sadly, and with no greeting smile,<br />
That we twain met at our meetings: but no growth of hate was
yet,<br />
Though my heart at first would be sinking as our thoughts and our
eyes they met:<br />
And when he spake amidst us and as one we two agreed,<br />
And I knew of his faith and his wisdom, then sore was my heart
indeed.<br />
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>We shrank
from meeting alone: for the words we had to say<br />
Our thoughts would nowise fashion&mdash;not yet for many a
day.</p>
<p class="poetry">Unhappy days of all days!&nbsp; Yet O might
they come again!<br />
So sore as my longing returneth to their trouble and sorrow and
pain!</p>
<p class="poetry">But time passed, and once we were sitting, my
wife and I in our room,<br />
And it was in the London twilight and the February gloom,<br />
When there came a knock, and he entered all pale, though bright
were his eyes,<br />
And I knew that something had happened, and my heart to my mouth
did arise.<br />
&ldquo;It is over,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;&mdash;and beginning;
for Paris has fallen at last,<br />
And who knows what next shall happen after all that has happened
and passed?<br />
There now may we all be wanted.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took up the
word: &ldquo;Well then<br />
Let us go, we three together, and there to die like
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to live and
be happy like men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he flushed up red,<br />
And she no less as she hearkened, as one thought through their
bodies had sped.<br />
Then I reached out my hand unto him, and I kissed her once on the
brow,<br />
But no word craving forgiveness, and no word of pardon e&rsquo;en
now,<br />
Our minds for our mouths might fashion.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the February
gloom<br />
And into the dark we sat planning, and there was I in the
room,<br />
And in speech I gave and I took; but yet alone and apart<br />
In the fields where I once was a youngling whiles wandered the
thoughts of my heart,<br />
And whiles in the unseen Paris, and the streets made ready for
war.<br />
Night grew and we lit the candles, and we drew together more,<br
/>
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>And whiles
we differed a little as we settled what to do,<br />
And my soul was cleared of confusion as nigher the deed-time
drew.</p>
<p class="poetry">Well, I took my child into the country, as we
had settled there,<br />
And gave him o&rsquo;er to be cherished by a kindly woman&rsquo;s
care,<br />
A friend of my mother&rsquo;s, but younger: and for Arthur, I let
him give<br />
His money, as mine was but little, that the boy might flourish
and live,<br />
Lest we three, or I and Arthur, should perish in tumult and
war,<br />
And at least the face of his father he should look on never
more.<br />
You cry out shame on my honour?&nbsp; But yet remember again<br
/>
That a man in my boy was growing; must my passing pride and
pain<br />
Undo the manhood within him and his days and their doings
blight?<br />
So I thrust my pride away, and I did what I deemed was right,<br
/>
And left him down in our country.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And well may you
think indeed<br />
How my sad heart swelled at departing from the peace of river and
mead,<br />
But I held all sternly aback and again to the town did I pass.<br
/>
And as alone I journeyed, this was ever in my heart:<br />
&ldquo;They may die; they may live and be happy; but for me I
know my part,<br />
In Paris to do my utmost, and there in Paris to die!&rdquo;<br />
And I said, &ldquo;The day of the deeds and the day of
deliverance is nigh.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>XI<br

A GLIMPSE OF THE COMING DAY</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">It</span> was strange
indeed, that journey!&nbsp; Never yet had I crossed the sea<br />
Or looked on another people than the folk that had fostered
me,<br />
And my heart rose up and fluttered as in the misty night<br />
We came on the fleet of the fishers slow rolling in the light<br
/>
Of the hidden moon, as the sea dim under the false dawn lay;<br
/>
And so like shadows of ships through the night they faded
away,<br />
And Calais pier was upon us.&nbsp; Dreamlike it was indeed<br />
As we sat in the train together, and toward the end made
speed.<br />
But a dull sleep came upon me, and through the sleep a dream<br
/>
Of the Frenchman who once was my master by the side of the
willowy stream;<br />
And he talked and told me tales of the war unwaged as yet,<br />
And the victory never won, and bade me never forget,<br />
While I walked on, still unhappy, by the home of the dark-striped
perch.<br />
Till at last, with a flash of light and a rattle and side-long
lurch,<br />
I woke up dazed and witless, till my sorrow awoke again,<br />
And the grey of the morn was upon us as we sped through the
poplar plain,<br />
By the brimming streams and the houses with their grey roofs
warped and bent,<br />
And the horseless plough in the furrow, and things fair and
innocent.<br />
And there sat my wife before me, and she, too, dreamed as she
slept;<br />
For the slow tears fell from her eyelids as in her sleep she
wept.<br />
<a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>But Arthur
sat by my side and waked; and flushed was his face,<br />
And his eyes were quick to behold the picture of each fair
place<br />
That we flashed by as on we hurried; and I knew that the joy of
life<br />
Was strongly stirred within him by the thought of the coming
strife.<br />
Then I too thought for a little, It is good in grief&rsquo;s
despite,<br />
It is good to see earth&rsquo;s pictures, and so live in the day
and the light.<br />
Yea, we deemed that to death we were hastening, and it made our
vision clear,<br />
And we knew the delight of our life-days, and held their sorrow
dear.</p>
<p class="poetry">But now when we came unto Paris and were out in
the sun and the street,<br />
It was strange to see the faces that our wondering eyes did
meet;<br />
Such joy and peace and pleasure!&nbsp; That folk were glad we
knew,<br />
But knew not the why and the wherefore; and we who had just come
through<br />
The vanquished land and down-cast, and there at St. Denis
e&rsquo;en now<br />
Had seen the German soldiers, and heard their bugles blow,<br />
And the drum and fife go rattling through the freshness of the
morn&mdash;<br />
Yet here we beheld all joyous the folk they had made forlorn!<br
/>
So at last from a grey stone building we saw a great flag fly,<br
/>
One colour, red and solemn &rsquo;gainst the blue of the
spring-tide sky,<br />
And we stopped and turned to each other, and as each at each did
we gaze,<br />
The city&rsquo;s hope enwrapped us with joy and great amaze.</p>
<p class="poetry">As folk in a dream we washed and we ate, and in
all detail,<br />
Oft told and in many a fashion, did we have all yesterday&rsquo;s
tale:<br />
How while we were threading our tangle of trouble in London
there,<br />
And I for my part, let me say it, within but a step of
despair,<br />
In Paris the day of days had betid; for the vile dwarf&rsquo;s
stroke,<br />
To madden Paris and crush her, had been struck and the dull sword
broke;<br />
There was now no foe and no fool in the city, and Paris was
free;<br />
And e&rsquo;en as she is this morning, to-morrow all France will
be.<br />
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>We heard,
and our hearts were saying, &ldquo;In a little while all the
earth&mdash;&rdquo;<br />
And that day at last of all days I knew what life was worth;<br
/>
For I saw what few have beheld, a folk with all hearts gay.<br />
Then at last I knew indeed that our word of the coming day,<br />
That so oft in grief and in sorrow I had preached, and scarcely
knew<br />
If it was but despair of the present or the hope of the day that
was due&mdash;<br />
I say that I saw it now, real, solid and at hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">And strange how my heart went back to our
little nook of the land,<br />
And how plain and clear I saw it, as though I longed indeed<br />
To give it a share of the joy and the satisfaction of need<br />
That here in the folk I beheld.&nbsp; For this in our country
spring<br />
Did the starlings bechatter the gables, and the thrush in the
thorn-bush sing,<br />
And the green cloud spread o&rsquo;er the willows, and the little
children rejoice<br />
And shout midst a nameless longing to the morning&rsquo;s mingled
voice;<br />
For this was the promise of spring-tide, and the new leaves
longing to burst,<br />
And the white roads threading the acres, and the sun-warmed
meadows athirst.<br />
Once all was the work of sorrow and the life without reward,<br
/>
And the toil that fear hath bidden, and the folly of master and
lord;<br />
But now are all things changing, and hope without a fear<br />
Shall speed us on through the story of the changes of the
year.<br />
Now spring shall pluck the garland that summer weaves for all,<br
/>
And autumn spread the banquet and winter fill the hall.<br />
O earth, thou kind bestower, thou ancient fruitful place,<br />
How lovely and beloved now gleams thy happy face!</p>
<p class="poetry">And O mother, mother, I said, hadst thou known
as I lay in thy lap,<br />
And for me thou hopedst and fearedst, on what days my life should
hap,<br />
Hadst thou known of the death that I look for, and the deeds
wherein I should deal,<br />
How calm had been thy gladness!&nbsp; How sweet hadst thou smiled
on my weal!<br />
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>As some
woman of old hadst thou wondered, who hath brought forth a god of
the earth,<br />
And in joy that knoweth no speech she dreams of the happy
birth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea, fair were those hours indeed, whatever
hereafter might come,<br />
And they swept over all my sorrow, and all thought of my wildered
home.<br />
But not for dreams of rejoicing had we come across the sea:<br />
That day we delivered the letters that our friends had given to
me,<br />
And we craved for some work for the cause.&nbsp; And what work
was there indeed,<br />
But to learn the business of battle and the manner of dying at
need?<br />
We three could think of none other, and we wrought our best
therein;<br />
And both of us made a shift the sergeant&rsquo;s stripes to
win,<br />
For diligent were we indeed: and he, as in all he did,<br />
Showed a cheerful ready talent that nowise might be hid,<br />
And yet hurt the pride of no man that he needs must step
before.<br />
But as for my wife, the <i>brancard</i> of the ambulance-women
she wore,<br />
And gently and bravely would serve us; and to all as a sister to
be&mdash;<br />
A sister amidst of the strangers&mdash;and, alas! a sister to
me.</p>

MEETING THE WAR-MACHINE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">So</span> we dwelt in the
war-girdled city as a very part of its life.<br />
Looking back at it all from England, I an atom of the strife,<br
/>
I can see that I might have seen what the end would be from the
first,<br />
The hope of man devoured in the day when the Gods are athirst.<br
/>
But those days we lived, as I tell you, a life that was not our
own;<br />
And we saw but the hope of the world, and the seed that the ages
had sown,<br />
Spring up now a fair-blossomed tree from the earth lying over the
dead;<br />
Earth quickened, earth kindled to spring-tide with the blood that
her lovers have shed,<br />
With the happy days cast off for the sake of her happy day,<br />
With the love of women foregone, and the bright youth worn
away,<br />
With the gentleness stripped from the lives thrust into the
jostle of war,<br />
With the hope of the hardy heart forever dwindling afar.</p>
<p class="poetry">O Earth, Earth, look on thy lovers, who knew
all thy gifts and thy gain,<br />
But cast them aside for thy sake, and caught up barren pain!<br
/>
Indeed of some art thou mindful, and ne&rsquo;er shalt forget
their tale,<br />
Till shrunk are the floods of thine ocean and thy sun is waxen
pale.<br />
But rather I bid thee remember e&rsquo;en these of the latter
days,<br />
Who were fed by no fair promise and made drunken by no praise.<br
/>
For them no opening heaven reached out the martyr&rsquo;s
crown;<br />
No folk delivered wept them, and no harvest of renown<br />
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>They
reaped with the scythe of battle; nor round their dying bed<br />
Did kindly friendly farewell the dew of blessing shed;<br />
In the sordid streets of the city mid a folk that knew them
not,<br />
In the living death of the prison didst thou deal them out their
lot,<br />
Yet foundest them deeds to be doing; and no feeble folk were
they<br />
To scowl on their own undoing and wail their lives away;<br />
But oft were they blithe and merry and deft from the strife to
wring<br />
Some joy that others gained not midst their peaceful
wayfaring.<br />
So fared they, giftless ever, and no help of fortune sought.<br
/>
Their life was thy deliverance, O Earth, and for thee they
fought;<br />
Mid the jeers of the happy and deedless, mid failing friends they
went<br />
To their foredoomed fruitful ending on the love of thee
intent.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea and we were a part of it all, the beginning
of the end,<br />
That first fight of the uttermost battle whither all the nations
wend;<br />
And yet could I tell you its story, you might think it little and
mean.<br />
For few of you now will be thinking of the day that might have
been,<br />
And fewer still meseemeth of the day that yet shall be,<br />
That shall light up that first beginning and its tangled
misery.<br />
For indeed a very machine is the war that now men wage;<br />
Nor have we hold of its handle, we gulled of our heritage,<br />
We workmen slaves of machines.&nbsp; Well, it ground us small
enough<br />
This machine of the beaten Bourgeois; though oft the work was
rough<br />
That it turned out for its money.&nbsp; Like other young soldiers
at first<br />
I scarcely knew the wherefore why our side had had the worst;<br
/>
For man to man and in knots we faced the matter well;<br />
And I thought, well to-morrow or next day a new tale will be to
tell.<br />
I was fierce and not afraid; yet O were the wood-sides fair,<br
/>
And the crofts and the sunny gardens, though death they harboured
there!<br />
And few but fools are fain of leaving the world outright,<br />
And the story over and done, and an end of the life and the
light.<br />
No hatred of life, thou knowest, O Earth, mid the bullets I
bore,<br />
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Though
pain and grief oppressed me that I never may suffer more.<br />
But in those days past over did life and death seem one;<br />
Yea the life had we attained to which could never be undone.</p>
<p class="poetry">You would have me tell of the fighting?&nbsp;
Well, you know it was new to me,<br />
Yet it soon seemed as if it had been for ever, and ever would
be.<br />
The morn when we made that sally, some thought (and yet not I)<br
/>
That a few days and all would be over: just a few had got to
die,<br />
And the rest would be happy thenceforward.&nbsp; But my stubborn
country blood<br />
Was bidding me hold my halloo till we were out of the wood.<br />
And that was the reason perhaps why little disheartened I was,<br
/>
As we stood all huddled together that night in a helpless
mass,<br />
As beaten men are wont: and I knew enough of war<br />
To know midst its unskilled labour what slips full often are.</p>
<p class="poetry">There was Arthur unhurt beside me, and my wife
come back again,<br />
And surely that eve between us there was love though no lack of
pain<br />
As we talked all the matter over, and our hearts spake more than
our lips;<br />
And we said, &ldquo;We shall learn, we shall learn&mdash;yea,
e&rsquo;en from disasters and slips.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Well, many a thing we learned, but we learned
not how to prevail<br />
O&rsquo;er the brutal war-machine, the ruthless grinder of
bale;<br />
By the bourgeois world it was made, for the bourgeois world; and
we,<br />
We were e&rsquo;en as the village weaver &rsquo;gainst the
power-loom, maybe.<br />
It drew on nearer and nearer, and we &rsquo;gan to look to the
end&mdash;<br />
We three, at least&mdash;and our lives began with death to
blend;<br />
Though we were long a-dying&mdash;though I dwell on yet as a
ghost<br />
In the land where we once were happy, to look on the loved and
the lost.</p>

THE STORY&rsquo;S ENDING</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">How</span> can I tell you
the story of the Hope and its defence?<br />
We wrought in a narrow circle; it was hither and thither and
thence;<br />
To the walls, and back for a little; to the fort and there to
abide,<br />
Grey-beards and boys and women; they lived there&mdash;and they
died;<br />
Nor counted much in the story.&nbsp; I have heard it told since
then,<br />
And mere lies our deeds have turned to in the mouths of happy
men,<br />
And e&rsquo;en those will be soon forgotten as the world wends on
its way,<br />
Too busy for truth or kindness.&nbsp; Yet my soul is seeing the
day<br />
When those who are now but children the new generation shall
be,<br />
And e&rsquo;en in our land of commerce and the workshop over the
sea,<br />
Amid them shall spring up the story; yea the very breath of the
air<br />
To the yearning hearts of the workers true tale of it all shall
bear.<br />
Year after year shall men meet with the red flag over head,<br />
And shall call on the help of the vanquished and the kindness of
the dead.<br />
And time that weareth most things, and the years that overgrow<br
/>
The tale of the fools triumphant, yet clearer and clearer shall
show<br />
The deeds of the helpers of menfolk to every age and clime,<br />
The deeds of the cursed and the conquered that were wise before
their time.</p>
<p class="poetry">Of these were my wife and my friend; there they
ended their wayfaring<br />
Like the generations before them thick thronging as leaves of the
spring,<br />
Fast falling as leaves of the autumn as the ancient singer hath
said,<br />
And each one with a love and a story.&nbsp; Ah the grief of the
early dead!<br />
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&ldquo;What is all this talk?&rdquo; you are saying;
&ldquo;why all this long delay?&rdquo;<br />
Yes, indeed, it is hard in the telling.&nbsp; Of things too
grievous to say<br />
I would be, but cannot be, silent.&nbsp; Well, I hurry on to the
end&mdash;<br />
For it drew to the latter ending of the hope that we helped to
defend.<br />
The forts were gone and the foemen drew near to the thin-manned
wall,<br />
And it wanted not many hours to the last hour and the fall,<br />
And we lived amid the bullets and seldom went away<br />
To what as yet were the streets by night-tide or by day.<br />
We three, we fought together, and I did the best I could,<br />
Too busy to think of the ending; but Arthur was better than
good;<br />
Resourceful, keen and eager, from post to post he ran,<br />
To thrust out aught that was moving and bring up the uttermost
man,<br />
He was gone on some such errand, and was absent a little
space,<br />
When I turned about for a moment and saw my wife&rsquo;s fair
face,<br />
And her foot set firm on the rampart, as she hastened here and
there,<br />
To some of our wounded comrades such help as she could to
bear.<br />
Then straight she looked upon me with such lovely, friendly
eyes<br />
Of the days gone by and remembered, that up from my heart
&rsquo;gan rise<br />
The choking sobbing passion; but I kept it aback, and smiled,<br
/>
And waved my hand aloft&mdash;But therewith her face turned
wild<br />
In a moment of time, and she stared along the length of the
wall,<br />
And I saw a man who was running and crouching, stagger and
fall,<br />
And knew it for Arthur at once; but voiceless toward him she
ran,<br />
I with her, crying aloud.&nbsp; But or ever we reached the
man,<br />
Lo! a roar and a crash around us and my sick brain whirling
around,<br />
And a white light turning to black, and no sky and no air and no
ground,<br />
And then what I needs must tell of as a great blank; but
indeed<br />
No words to tell of its horror hath language for my need:<br />
As a map is to a picture, so is all that my words can say.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when I came to myself, in a friend&rsquo;s
house sick I lay<br />
Amid strange blended noises, and my own mind wandering there;<br
/>
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>Delirium
in me indeed and around me everywhere.<br />
That passed, and all things grew calmer, I with them: all the
stress<br />
That the last three months had been on me now sank to
helplessness.<br />
I bettered, and then they told me the tale of what had betid;<br
/>
And first, that under the name of a friend of theirs I was
hid,<br />
Who was slain by mere misadventure, and was English as was I,<br
/>
And no rebel, and had due papers wherewith I might well slip
by<br />
When I was somewhat better.&nbsp; Then I knew, though they had
not told,<br />
How all was fallen together, and my heart grew sick and cold.<br
/>
And yet indeed thenceforward I strove my life to live,<br />
That e&rsquo;en as I was and so hapless I yet might live to
strive.<br />
It was but few words they told me of that murder great and
grim,<br />
And how with the blood of the guiltless the city&rsquo;s streets
did swim,<br />
And of other horrors they told not, except in a word or two,<br
/>
When they told of their scheme to save me from the hands of the
villainous crew,<br />
Whereby I guessed what was happening in the main without
detail.<br />
And so at last it came to their telling the other tale<br />
Of my wife and my friend; though that also methought I knew too
well.<br />
Well, they said that I had been wounded by the fragment of a
shell,<br />
Another of which had slain her outright, as forth she ran<br />
Toward Arthur struck by a bullet.&nbsp; She never touched the
man<br />
Alive and she also alive; but thereafter as they lay<br />
Both dead on one litter together, then folk who knew not us,<br
/>
But were moved by seeing the twain so fair and so piteous,<br />
Took them for husband and wife who were fated there to die,<br />
Or, it may be lover and lover indeed&mdash;but what know I?</p>
<p class="poetry">Well, you know that I &rsquo;scaped from Paris,
and crossed the narrow sea,<br />
And made my way to the country where we twain were wont to be,<br
/>
And that is the last and the latest of the tale I have to
tell.<br />
I came not here to be bidding my happiness farewell,<br />
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>And to
nurse my grief and to win me the gain of a wounded life,<br />
That because of the bygone sorrow may hide away from the
strife.<br />
I came to look to my son, and myself to get stout and strong,<br
/>
That two men there might be hereafter to battle against the
wrong;<br />
And I cling to the love of the past and the love of the day to
be,<br />
And the present, it is but the building of the man to be strong
in me.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
